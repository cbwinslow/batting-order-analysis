    Author: Drew Scott, 2021
    Description:
        Simulates every possible batting order for a given lineup and displays summary statistics of the average runs (over a number of games) of the
        orders, and specific information about the top and bottom 5 orders. The user may choose how many games each order is simulated for, which
        players are in the lineup, or what each player's PA outcomes are in a single game (see sample files).
    Major TODOs:
        1) Determine the accurate likelihoods of sacrifices and double plays for different out types (ground, fly, etc.)
        2) Enable some sort of pinch hitting scheme (right now, each player hits for the entire game)
        3) Enable some sort of pitcher dependent hitting results (even as simple as right-y/left-y; right now hitting stats are full season aggregates)
        4) Include edge cases like stealing, wild pitches, etc.
        5) More detailed data (i.e. did a double go to right or left field?)
        6) Player specific data (i.e. how often does a player try to steal?)
    Usage:
        For a random lineup:
            python3 battingorder.py -n <simulations_per_order>
        For a prespecified lineup of 9 players, format it like giants.txt (ensure naming corresponds to stats.csv)
            python3 battingorder.py -lf <lineup filename> -n <simulations_per_order>
        For a prespecified lineup of 9 players and at-bat outcomes (format like giants_outcomes.txt)
            python3 battingorder.py -lf <lineup filename> -of <outcomes filename>
