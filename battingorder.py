    Author: Drew Scott
    Description: Selects a lineup of 9 players from stats.csv and simulates all possible batting orders, determing which results in
        the most average runs per 9 innings. Prints out summary statistics for the simulation.
    Usage: If you want to supply a determined line up of 9 players, format it like giants.txt (ensure naming corresponds to stats.csv)
        python3 battingorder.py -f <filename> -n <simulations_per_order>
